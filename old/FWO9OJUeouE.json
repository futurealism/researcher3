it has been one heck of a year in AI at the beginning of this year I had I think about 4,000 subscribers and I've just hit 100,000 subscribers and that is due in large part to artificial intelligence and of course uh chat GPT has exploded on the scene and it's been a year of intense drama most recently with the firing and sudden rehiring of Sam Alman but we're not going to talk about the people of AI we're going to talk about the re evolutions of AI the things that I am looking forward to in 2024 now before we get started one thing I want to say is what I'm going to do is I'm looking at kind of what is happening today so all of this is rooted in Trends and news that has come out recently but what I'm really going to focus on is kind of some of the stuff that I expect to see in 2024 take it with a grain of salt as with all predictions it's basically a gamble so let's Dive Right In first and foremost is uh AI being integrated more into mental health and relationships so there's already been plenty of stories out there about uh you know people using chat Bots to learn about relationships and get better at communication and that sort of thing but after some of the videos that I've made I've had people reach out to me uh including clinical psychologists researchers forensic psychologists all kinds of people and so not just from a user perspective uh but also from a a research perspec perspective I suspect that AI is in the long run going to be just completely gamechanging for the way that we approach uh mental health and relationships and not just on an individual level so for instance one thing that uh you know I've had my criticisms of anthropics Claude chatbot but one thing that it's in incredibly good at is dream interpretation and I suspect that those kinds of abilities are only going to get better over time where the these these machines these tools will help you figure out what's going on in your life what's going on in your head what's going on in your relationships and also the fact that it's already being studied by governments and universities means that the deployment of these Technologies is going to pick up and accelerate I am looking forward to 20 years from now a Freakonomics episode unpacking the long-term impacts the positive long-term impacts of generative AI on mental health and relationships and I think that this is really going to take off in 2024 I think we're going to start seeing more studies being published about the beneficial use of AI in mental health and relationships and communication I think we're going to start seeing best practices being published and I think we're going to start seeing people really starting to take this seriously on a clinical um and and societal and epidemiological level so I in the long run the the the total impact of AI on mental health and relationships I think is difficult to oversell and I think that we're going to really see Mass ad option um in the form of you know more smartphone apps more products and services but also Government research and endorsements so this is going to be pretty big and I think 2024 is going to be a breakout year for mental health and relationships with respect to artificial intelligence next is content moderation so as a YouTuber obviously there's comments there's you know I've got Discord servers there's Reddit and all sorts of other things YouTube for fortunately has announced that they are going to start in implementing more and more AI into content moderation and I hope that plenty of other platforms start to do this as well and there's all kinds of ways that content moderation can be can be done which by and large is done kind of reactively and by hand so you know back in the day and probably still to this day but I don't use Facebook anymore um their content moderators were largely uh humans and so these would these were people that were constantly just for 8 hours a day looking at material that had been flagged and they'd seen all kinds of awful things from you know depictions of violence to like sex trafficking and all all sorts of stuff and like there are reports of people getting PTSD just from being content moderators and of course like if you follow the news the same happens on PornHub but they have like a tiny like core of content moderators and so there's like months and months of backlog and who wants to watch porn all day like that's just like especially if you're looking at the gross stuff that gets flagged anyways so fact uh factchecking disinformation and misinformation campaign detection CU one of the things that we're afraid of is you know generative AI being used um in troll farms and botn Nets for political manipulation but a technology that can be used to spread misinformation can be just as easily used to detect that kind of stuff and do factchecking and just automatically filter out this kind of stuff hate hate speech um Community shaping I actually had people reach out to me that are working on using these AI tools to help shape and push narratives and shape online communities um so that that's something that can be automated algorithmically rather than um being done by hand I've tried this myself I created a few chat Bots that were uh connected to my Discord server to help with like Auto moderation and steering things but they really got repetitive and I don't have the time and energy to research it and and practice it myself but I think that 2024 is going to see a huge wave of AI based content moderation which in the long run I think is going to is finally going to solve the problem of toxicity on the internet meaning if someone you know rage tweets or whatever then one you can detect what that is about and you can you can uh deliberately kind of modify the conversation and rather than uh toxicity being Amplified you can reduce radicalization and polarization with the aid of AI uh to benevolent ends now of course the flip side of that is that you can use AI to deliberately fan the Flames so hopefully we see content moderation as the antidote to uh radical toxicity Material Science is going to be a huge thing in 2024 as well we just we've seen uh Google Deep Mind publish their gnome paper which was what was it like 2.2 million new materials new crystals were discovered um and so I expect this kind of thing is going to accelerate um and like math it's not immediately obvious that Material Science affects everything but Material Science affects everything if it includes metals or Plastics or proteins it affects Material Science um or Material Science affects it rather I've got that backwards um but everything from uh computer technology such as you know getting down to two nanometer uh you know production methods uh rapidly producing new medicines the all the equipment that uh that is used to synthesize medicines or detect medicines like all of these things are going to be accelerated by Material Science and Material Science is being accelerated by artificial intelligence and this is also part of a virtuous cycle so I've talked about this it's been a while since I've talked about this but the combination of better Ai and better Material Science and better math forms a virtuous cycle that that only serves to accelerate AI even more because the better Material Science you have the better computers you have which leads to faster AI more AI higher density data that sort of stuff and so any acceleration that you get in Material Science translates it it it does take a while because the time that it takes to design a new chip and take it from from hypothetical design to manufacturer something like I think 5 years it might be less now it might be more but so it'll be a little while before we start to feel it um however I think that 2024 is going to be a breakout year um in Material Science broadly um and it'll be driven largely to due to um artificial intelligence and also Material Science is one of the key things that will help us unlock uh things like sustainable energy nuclear fusion Quantum Computing is largely A Material Science problem so 2024 is going to be like I said a huge year for this I expect to see some really big breakthroughs we might not see the practical application yet but I'm really excited to see what happens in material science uh driven by AI in 2024 so synthetic data has been in the news lately um namely there's rumors that open Ai and others are are creating and training models that are trained on 60% synthetic data I think one of the rumors is 90% synthetic data and the thing is is if it's just text that's one thing but we're we're talking about this flywheel that as machines get better at generating synthetic data and then being trained on synthetic synthetic data you basically have an unlimited amount of data with which to train on any modality any format so we we see that synthetic data is being used to train self-driving cars um most of the images that you see on the internet today well maybe not most but something like 60% of them are now generated by by AI soon music movies images everything is going to be generated by Ai and that is all going to uh again feed back into a virtuous cycle where the more data you have to train on and the more you have to sift through um in order to create very very good data sets means that this is going to be a data flywheel that accelerates very fast um and also I predict personally this is just kind of the reading the tea leaves and if you saw the news the reason that I picked Sarah Silverman here is because um her her class action lawsuit against open AI was grievously hamstrung by the judge which is something that I predicted in a previous video having talked to some of my lawyer friends there's just a lot of the case that was just like on the face just wouldn't stand up to scrutiny um but anyways so we'll see how it's litigated we have yet to see AI copyright law get litigated by the Supreme Court as far as I know um but you know copyright is basically being gutted in real time and I predict that if you have this data flywheel where most data is synthetic it's generated by AI the the the marginal cost of data even highly valuable data like a novel or a movie approaches zero and I think that we're seeing the death of copyright um now we did see that the the the the the writer Guild and the actor's guild they are like oh well you know human human contribution only but I kind of see it going the same way as like you know photographers uh were were attacked by painters and then photographers attack digital artists and digital artists are attacking AI like this is just the ne next natural progression so we're just seeing another transition in the creation of uh digital of of entertainment in general um but data more broadly to cap it off 2024 I think is when we'll see some of that litigation happening but also we're going to see that data flywheel kick it up into height gear okay so the next thing is we're starting to see more and more interest in medical and clinical deployments of AI so again because of some of the videos that I've made I've had all kinds of people I've got a whole bunch of uh Physicians surgeons all kinds of people even some of my patreon supporters they're so excited about the things that I'm talking about that they decided to jump in and I've actually connected some of them um but the the thing is is that AI has the potential to uh really revolutionize Healthcare one of the more extreme predictions that I've made is that I suspect that hospitals are going to go the way of the dinosaur probably within 20 years we'll see um when you when you combine Rejuvenation therapies with robot doctors I suspect that the need for hospitals is going to drop drastically but in the short term there's already evidence that AI is accelerating um Diagnostics it's increasing the accuracy of diagnosis it's also being used for patient engagement so a friend of mine uh he was working at a startup that one of the things that they did was allocating like reading all your medical charts and ensuring that you had you know the right medication and the right nurse and everything like that and so uh adding AI as a kind of like clinical social worker that that's reading all patients notes and all doctors notes and and and making sure everyone knows what they need we're you we're seeing that generative AI is already helping uh in the clinical setting and I think that that is going to uh again really accelerate in 2024 just for purely economic reasons if you're a hospital administrator and you hear that you know this generative AI tool can help you know reduce the cost of billing you know by 80% and reduce the you know the the incidents of getting sued for medical malpractice by 12% they're going to do it just by sheer econ economic pressure alone um and this is going to have compounding effects because it's like the more you use a thing and the more valuable it becomes the more investment it gets and the better it gets and the more it gets integrated and I think 2024 is going to be a breakout year for the integration of AI into uh the clinical space oh and also I've had like talks and interviews with um everyone from practicing uh clinicians to medical students medical students are super jazzed about this cuz some of them are are afraid of like being placed but I've talked to some medical students that are like oh my God please help us we need all the help we can get so I think that it's going to be net a net gain for everyone um regarding Ai and Medicine in 2024 so video generation uh at the beginning of this year meta AI released their really kind of dodgy you know really kind of almost dreamlike video generators and with in the space of less than a year we're getting up to I think we have 1080p uh video generation now it still has some artifacts but that was an exponential uh uh acceleration in terms of quality of video generation and what now you've probably seen Trends on the internet like on LinkedIn and and Reddit and stuff where people are posting like movie trailers like cinematic almost perfect uh movie trailers that are that are pretty high quality um and it's getting easier and easier to make this and this is one thing that I think it will probably be considered a solved problem this time next year so if you remember when Dolly 2 first came out it was kind of garbage um like the dreams or the the the images were kind of dreamlike they were blocky they were broken uh Dolly 3 is a Quantum Leap Forward mid journey and a whole bunch of other stable diffusion are all coming out and they're all uh improving very quickly so I think this time next year like image generation like this stock image there will be no demand for humans to generate this kind of stuff a Adobe is is leading the charge in terms of replacing the stock image industry instead of photographers it's all going to be AI generated before too long and likewise I think that video generation because video is just a series of images right um I think that video generation is going to be not long behind that and um and I think this time next year I'll probably be working on creating like a Hollywood grade version of my novel doing it all by myself that's what I'm really looking forward to in 2024 with video generation to uh extend the conversation around Ai and um entertainment we're already seeing mods being built to integrate like chat GPT with Skyrim and stuff like that but I think that it's we're a we're a Stones throw away from the the the big game studios and the big game engines just creating native Integrations with generative AI now obviously generative AI is still relatively expensive to use but the cost is coming down fast and I I would I would not be surprised if this time next year you have games that have NPCs that you can just put on your headset and you can just have a natural conversation with the NPCs and so like I've heard that CD project red is abandoning uh cyberpunk 2077 but if they ever make a sequel I fully expect to be able to just like talk to Johnny silverander or whatever um like real time uh just natural natural sounding conversation um and that's just on the surface that's just having conversations with NPCs the on that I'm looking forward to automatically generating narratives so having completely Dynamic and adaptive worlds that respond to your unique decisions within that world and that the that the the quests and the story lines and the character lines all adapt in real time that's something that I'm really looking forward to in the gaming space um and I think that we're going to see the first uh versions of this being commercially reduced uh uh released in 2024 um and again it's that this is just the beginning longevity research I suspect is going to really be kicked into high gear in 2024 uh you a lot of you probably just saw that the the X prize announced uh what is it $101 million to accelerate longevity research the Biden Administration just created a um a package I think it was like $2.4 billion dollar over the next 10 years for uh and and one of the one of the explicitly stated goals was to overcome aging to basically treat aging as a disease that needs to be cured um and so 2024 is going to be a huge breakout year for this and it's going to be like the the the the temperature of this is going to be turned up to 11 by breakthroughs such as Google deep mines Alpha fold 2 I'm looking forward to Alpha fold 3 if they're working on it or whatever the successor technology is um now obviously just s just simulating proteins is only one part of it um I've talked about in previous videos that the entire U metabolome so all the metabolites and and all the respiratory and met metabolic processes that happen in the body there are literally hundreds of thousands of substances in the human body alone on top of three billion base pairs on top of microbiomes on top of epigenetics so we do have a ways to go before we solve all of these problems but uh the investment is there and when investment is there uh Solutions follow that's just the way it goes and as of right now there are as far as I know there are no scientific or engineering barriers to overcome it's mostly just about the data like we have the premise we know how to simulate these things and we know how to get more accurate but the volume of data and the amount of processing that needs to be done is is the is the primary thing that's prohibitively expensive right now um but you go back to the material science thing that accelerates that well if the if the gpus get cheaper and faster and all the sensors and and other lab equipment gets cheaper and faster you get those compounding returns and so I think 2024 is going to be a breakout year where people um I have said that we're probably already in longevity escape velocity meaning and so the definition of longevity escape velocity is that the life expectancy goes up uh per year of more than one year per year um so for those for those that are young enough and healthy enough I suspect we're already in longevity escape velocity so net result is I think 2024 people are going to start taking the the concept of longevity escape velocity more seriously and that we're going to all realize yeah we're in it math and logic so much much hu has been made of qar and the uh other leaks uh recently but more broadly uh math and formal logic is being studied in deep learning and uh one thing that this that the whole qar thing has helped to shine a light on is that generating text and planning and reasoning that's one thing but math and logic is like the other half of the puzzle to get to AGI and you know when you when you think about what is machine learning what is Agi what is computer science what is Material Science it all boils down to math um math is the underpinning language of all of these things and so now we have language models that have mastered language um at least on certain scales they're still not good at write like writing full length novels in one shot but that's coming soon um so when you have these s these same or similar models that Master uh math and logic um to the you know achieve 99th percentile performance on math and logic compared to humans then you have a machine that is like okay well it can do things that most humans can't and it understands all the rudiments all the fundamental abilities that are required for scientific advancement so one of the benchmarks um that people have and it's kind of tongue-in-cheek but there is some Merit to it is like when AI discovers novel physics then you know that it's like game over because once you once you're able to do that once you're able to like either create a paradigm shift in math Andor physics then it's like okay like humans become uh irrelevant very quickly um at least uh partially uh in in the advancement of science so uh 2024 I think is going to be a huge breakout year for Math and logic in the area of artificial intelligence and this is this is going to be another component that feeds into that virtuous cycle that accelerates everything even faster um so this is what you might say is the ramp up to Singularity I'm still personally skeptical about Singularity but certainly we seem like we're still in an acceleration phase the only question is how long will that acceleration phase last and then finally number 10 AGI in 2024 so I am standing firm on my prediction that by September 2024 so about 10 months from now we will almost certainly have basically any basic definition of AGI will probably be satisfied and there are five primary trends that I'm looking at when I make this prediction so first multimodality um integrating text audio video embodiment data and other kinds of data um into Transformers math and logic language all of this stuff when you look at all the modalities being crammed into Lang into uh Transformers today it becomes very obvious that we're we're literally running out of the different not just amount of data but the types of data that we can train these things on um and so once you have models that are trained on literally all of human data like there's not much there's not much else you can do um so that is one of the main Trends that's coming I expect that we'll uh have some pretty significant algorithmic breakthroughs um and if not if not like uh step function changes at least lots of incremental breakthroughs around multimodality that are going to give us a fundamentally new appreciation for the capabilities of Transformer models by this time next year next up is autonomous agents so um you know things like Microsoft autogen some of my projects that I'm running um agents are the new operating system they're the new Damon um autonomous agents and autonomous agent swarms I think are going to be how AGI manifests it's not going to be you know a single monolithic robot and if you do have a single monolithic robot it's going to have a swarm of agents in its head um all debating and you know doing different parts of it so I think that I think that we've figured out kind of from a software perspective how AGI is going to be deployed I will stand by that prediction right now and again I didn't even predict it I often point to Mass Effect and the GU um so I think the GU is kind of the the version of AGI we're going to ultimately get where even if you do have a single platform there's many many agents running in that platform and some of those agents are going to be running in the cloud some of them are going to be running locally they can move around that sort of thing um I already mentioned logic integration so adding adding math and logic to the current linguistic abilities I think is going to be a GameChanger without algorithms like qar and whatever else is going on behind the scenes um all of this however is going to feed back into another virtuous cycle which is that the more capable AI gets the more it can participate in its own research so the qualia leak talked about how the AGI machine made recommendations to change its own engine and while I personally feel like the quality of paper is debunked I know researchers who are actively using AI to help with their research there are plenty of people using AI to help with their research and the more capable the AI becomes the more useful it is and the faster it goes and so uh that again that's another part of the flywheel is that the more the AI can help the faster it all goes the more capabilities it expands to the faster it all goes and then the last bit of information is investment surge I think investment in AI is basically doubling year over-ear right now and if not it's close um and that could if if that Trend even remotely stays the same even if investment only goes up 30% year-over-year or 50% year-over-year that is like exponential growth in terms of how much uh investment we're seeing towards Ai and again where the money goes results follow and so because of all that yeah I think that we're going to see AGI in 2024 now there's probably going to be some limitations it might be too expensive to run um there might be things that that humans are still better at um it's also going to take time to integrate these with government systems with Business Systems um it's going to take time to deploy applications that benefit from AGI but I do suspect we're going to see all this coming in 2024 so this is why I am super excited for 2024 thanks for watching I hope you got a lot
